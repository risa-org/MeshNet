# Contributing to MeshNet

## Current Status

MeshNet is in early development and **not yet ready for external contributions**. The core DHT and pairing systems are still being built and tested.

## When Contributions Will Be Accepted

We will open for contributions once:

- Phase 4 (device pairing) is complete and tested
- At least one bootstrap node is running
- DHT functionality is validated on a multi-node network
- Security issues documented in `dev-docs/meshnet-problems.md` are addressed

Expected timeline: Q2 2026

## How To Help Now

If you want to help before then:

1. **Test the existing code** - try running two nodes and report issues
2. **Run a bootstrap node** - if you have a stable server, let us know
3. **Review the documentation** - read `dev-docs/` and suggest improvements
4. **Join discussions** - open issues for design questions or ideas

## Future Contribution Areas

Once we're ready for contributors, we'll need help with:

- DNS resolver implementation
- Windows Service integration
- Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS)
- UI/UX design and development
- Documentation and tutorials
- Bootstrap node hosting

## Development Setup

See the Quick Start section in README.md for build instructions.

## Questions?

Open an issue and label it as a question. We're happy to discuss the project's direction and technical decisions.
